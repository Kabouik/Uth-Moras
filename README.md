# Uth-Moras
**Moras SC tool and databases for DAOC Uthgard 2.0**

This repository aims at providing donwload links for `Moras v1.74` and `item.xml` for all three realms in a single place that would be reliable on the long term (no expiration on Github, and the ability to bookmark and search repositories).

Multiple links for those files already exist on mediafire, dl.free, tinyupload or similar websites, but they can easily get lost or expire, and keeping track of versions on those websites can be very difficult since outdated versions may in some cases be better indexed than newer versions.

## How to use
1. Download and install Moras 1.74.exe (works with Wine too, if you are not using Windows)
2. Download the database for your realm, `item.xml.REALM`
3. Rename `Item.xml` in the Moras installation folder to `Item.xml.default`
4. Paste the `item.xml.REALM` file into the Moras installation folder and rename it to `item.xml`
5. Profit
