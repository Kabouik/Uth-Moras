# Moras SC tool and databases for DAOC Uthgard 2.0
This repository aims at providing download links for `Moras v1.74` and `items.xml` for all three realms in a single place, and make them reliable on the long term (Githubs offers ways to bookmark or search repositories, and repositories do not expire).

## Why?
Multiple links for those files already exist on mediafire, dl.free, tinyupload or similar file sharing websites, but they can easily get lost or expire, and keeping track of versions on those websites can be very difficult since outdated versions may in some cases be better indexed than newer versions. Additionally, the corresponding URLs are not always shared on the same forums and finding the latest links can be tricky. In general, one should not have to look through several forums and carefully compare post dates to finally use the Moras databases.

## How to use
1. Download and install `Moras-1.74.exe` (works with Wine too, if you are not using Windows)
2. Download the database for your realm, `items.xml.REALM`
3. Rename `Items.xml` from the Moras installation folder to `Items.xml.default`
4. Paste the `items.xml.REALM` file into the Moras installation folder and rename it to `items.xml`
5. Profit

## Disclaimer
The databases are the result of long data collections and may, in some cases, be based on databases from DAOC Live. Yet, many items have changed, no longer drop, or have never been available on Uthgard. It is therefore highly recommended to double check if the items you find in the Moras database actually exist on Uthgard (check housing for instance) before finalizing your template.
